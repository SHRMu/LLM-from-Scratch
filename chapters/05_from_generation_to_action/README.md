# Chapter 5: From Generation to Action: LLM Agents and Tool Use

So far, we've treated Large Language Models as powerful knowledge processors and text generators. Now, we'll give them the ability to act. This chapter delves into the exciting world of LLM Agents and tool use (function calling), where models can interact with external systems, APIs, and data sources to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks.

This chapter is divided into the following articles:

1.  [Introduction to Tool Use (Function Calling)](./01_introduction_to_tool_use.md)
2.  [The Agentic Loop: How LLMs "Think"](./02_the_agentic_loop.md)
3.  [Designing and Building an Agent](./03_designing_and_building_an_agent.md)
4.  [A Practical Example: Building a Simple Agent](./04_a_practical_example.md)
