# Chapter 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Large Language Models have vast knowledge, but it's frozen at the time of their training. How can we provide them with new, private, or real-time information? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the answer. This chapter explores how to connect LLMs to external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers.

This chapter is divided into the following articles:

1.  [What is RAG?](./01_what_is_rag.md)
2.  [Building a Knowledge Base](./02_building_a_knowledge_base.md)
3.  [The Retrieval Process](./03_the_retrieval_process.md)
4.  [The Generation Process](./04_the_generation_process.md)
5.  [A Practical RAG Example](./05_a_practical_rag_example.md)
