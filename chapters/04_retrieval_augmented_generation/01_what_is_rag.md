# What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a sophisticated technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by connecting them to external knowledge sources. At its core, RAG allows an LLM to pull in real-time information from a predefined database, documentation, or other data repositories before generating a response.

This approach directly addresses two of the most significant limitations of standalone LLMs:

1.  **Knowledge Cutoffs:** LLMs only know about the data they were trained on, which creates a "knowledge cutoff." They are unaware of events, developments, or information that has emerged since their last training cycle. RAG bridges this gap by providing the model with the most current information available in its connected knowledge source.
2.  **Access to Private Data:** Training a massive LLM is incredibly expensive and time-consuming. It is not feasible to retrain or even fine-tune a model every time you want it to learn a new set of private or proprietary documents. RAG offers a powerful solution by allowing the model to access and utilize this private data on-the-fly, without the need for retraining.

By combining the retrieval of relevant, up-to-date, or private information with the powerful generative capabilities of an LLM, RAG creates a system that is both more knowledgeable and more trustworthy.
