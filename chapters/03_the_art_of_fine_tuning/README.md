# Chapter 3: The Art of Fine-Tuning

Pre-trained models are powerful, but their true potential is unlocked when we adapt them to specific tasks. This process is called fine-tuning. In this chapter, we'll explore the concepts, techniques, and practical steps involved in specializing a general-purpose LLM for your unique needs.

This chapter is divided into the following articles:

1.  [What is Fine-Tuning?](./01_what_is_fine_tuning.md)
2.  [Preparing Your Dataset](./02_preparing_your_dataset.md)
3.  [Common Fine-Tuning Techniques](./03_common_fine_tuning_techniques.md)
4.  [A Practical Example](./04_a_practical_example.md)
5.  [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](./05_reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback.md)
