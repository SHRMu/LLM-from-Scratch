# Chapter 6: Advanced Techniques: Reasoning and Efficient Inference

Understanding the architecture of a Large Language Model is only the beginning. To truly unlock its potential, we must learn how to guide its "thinking" process and how to run it efficiently. This chapter covers the advanced techniques that separate basic use from sophisticated application, focusing on improving the quality of a model's output and the practicality of its deployment.

This chapter is divided into the following articles:

1.  [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](./00_introduction_to_reinforcement_learning.md)
2.  [Prompting for Reasoning: The Power of Chain-of-Thought](./01_prompting_for_reasoning.md)
3.  [Decoding Strategies: How LLMs Choose Their Words](./02_decoding_strategies.md)
4.  [Inference Optimization](./03_inference_optimization.md)
5.  [Hands-on Guide: Applying Decoding Strategies](./04_hands_on_guide_decoding.md)
